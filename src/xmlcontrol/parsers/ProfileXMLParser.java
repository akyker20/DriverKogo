/**
 * The purpose of this class is to parse the driver XML File. Two things
 * come of this. First, a list of video instances is created with this information.
 * Secondly, a map is created that maps each video to its node in the document.
 * The reason for this map is that when a change needs to be made (a video has been
 * watched and its play count changes), the node where the change needs to occur
 * in the document can be obtained simply from the video that was played.
