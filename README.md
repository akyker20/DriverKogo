KogoDrivers
===========

Kogo allows businesses to effectively advertise their products and services.

This is one of three applications created to make it easier for us, our drivers, and our clients.

This application is for our employees, drivers. We provide them with a deliverable folder that has
a folder containing the advertising videos as well as an XML File that dictates how many times 
each video can be played as well as other critical information. The program parses this data file
and then allows the driver to input the number of students watching advertisement during a given ride.
It then selects a video from the folder of advertising videos and plays this video using a JavaFX media player.
After a video finishes, another one is selected until the ride is over. Once the driver completes his/her
driving session, the driver exports a data file with the driving session statistics (how many times each video
was played, etc.). The driver then sends this data file to me, and using the KogoOwner Java application, I can
update the master XML File of advertising video information.
